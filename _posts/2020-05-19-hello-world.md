### My blog and First Thoughts


Welcome to my blog!


I really didn't expect myself to come this far in making a blog: this was something I've always thought of doing but never brought myself to completing. But now that I'm done, I think all this was worth a shot. 

To the people who helped made this possible (aka Fanpu) thanks for giving me your advice along the way which really made this process much more simpler :)

This blog is going to be about some interesting artifacts that I come across in school, some fun travel memories and perhaps random musings that I hope you find interesting.

I took the picture above wandering in Utah, travelling with some friends during my freshman year. I remember this scene particularly vividly. There was nothing to separate the earth and sky; snow was quietly falling, covering the boundless fields, endless roads equally in plain white. 

So casually, we got off the car, marked the virgin snow with our careless footprints, laughing while exploring the place. We didn't know where exactly we were heading towards, but we were so *free*. 


Yet these days, as I grow up and find things I feel passsionate about and people I love, ironically, I find myself feeling less *free* than before. It seems like finding and gathering these ever so important things sometimes, also, inadvertently weighs us down with the heavy fear of losing, losing our way,  losing these gems we've collected. 

This blog is an archive of the things that matter to me, and yet I also hope that this is a reminder to self to never forget the spirit of adventure. Making this blog is like a step into the unknown for me and I hope that my future self continues making many many more of such steps :)  


### Finally

Thank you so much for being here with me! This blog is still a huge Work In Progress and I still have a lot more improvements planned ahead. Hope you enjoy your stay here!
