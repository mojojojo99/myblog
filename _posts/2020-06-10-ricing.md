### My first attempt at life

One day, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed and decided to wipe out my ubuntu distro and start afresh with arch. Of course, this was a harrowing experience, even with an experienced friend helping me out with the installation. My takeaway: definitely not for the weak hearted. I have since learnt that maybe I should set myself up and sleep on the right side of the bed from now on.

Well, initially, I took the easy way of setting up my arch immediately with Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (LARBS) linked [here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS). This is a script that auto installs and autoconfigures a fully functioning minimal terminal and vim based Arch Linux environment.

The entire concept of LARBS was minimalism, from the choice of terminals, plugin managers, status bar etc. This is a highly recommended starting point for beginners like me -- I think it saved me a lot of hair pulling with regards to setting up all the nitty gritty services. However, even with such a big help, this change was a very radical shift for me, which I needed a lot of time (probably a massive understatement) to start getting used to.

The first thing I learnt was the taste of regret when I wanted to listen to music through my bluetooth earpieces. I cried when I realised that I had chosen the cli life but it probably didn't choose me -- I struggled so hard just to get it paired with `bluetoothctl`. To be fair, it worked the first try but everything somehow sounded lo-fi because of some incorrect audio settings. Never going to be taking for granted the annoying gui popups anymore.

The second thing I learnt was how regret also usually stays as an aftertaste. The next day, I went to school to be confronted by the lack of WiFI and another major panic attack just getting it to work, since without WiFI I also basically couldn't get help from my laptop at all. Other days, I start up my laptop in lecture only to find it stuck at the login cmdline page -- of course being me, my knee jerk reaction was switching it on and off frantically which did no help tbh (in hindsight, there was probably a flood of irqs by some devices plugged in).

The last thing I learnt was how to deal with my own insanity -- many of the times things just start breaking randomly and sometimes it's hard to keep one's mind mending them. At first, whenever these happen, I try to keep cool, listen to nice sad jazz music and debug, but not gonna lie sometimes things just don't work out. Those times, you just have to grit your teeth, mope a little, cry a little and then continue on. I can probably never be the calm and zen guru, rationally troubleshooting steps 0 - steps 65536 when all I have is a cmdline prompt and a blank screen; took me some decent amount of self realization to see how I was probably more chaotic than I thought myself out to be through these multiple death encounters. But maybe that was fine. I just had to live with that streak of insanity sometimes.

TLDR, this is the journey of a really beginner user of arch, who felt a tad bit too full of herself on a suicidal mission with arch.

## My first attempt at ricing

For a few months, I really loved the setup and also the minimalistic design of the larbs install.
Another day, I woke up with the sudden realization that my setup was looking pretty darn hacky (because of all the stuff I hacked together along the way) and this new found bold ambition to make my setup suck less. (Or maybe I was just feeling lucky tbh.) Also, I guess I was majorly disgusted with myself with regards to how I managed to leave the fn and brightness keys etc. non functional. This was probably a more pressing issue given I had to search up brightness and sound adjustment cli commands etc. whenever I wanted to make a change. But, as they always say, form over function. I was on a brave quest to change my setup design after it became an eyesore.

Fast forward a few days, this was how my new setup looks like:

Here's some information of the details of the set up:

- OS - Arch Linux
- WM - i3-gaps
- Bar - Polybar
- Shell - zsh
- Compositor - Picom
- Browser - Chromium
- Shellinfo - screenfetch
- Soundviewer - cli-visualizer
- Wallpaper - [link](https://images.pexels.com/photos/733995/pexels-photo-733995.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=3&h=750&w=1260)


My dotfiles are available in a github repo: I learnt having to back up my work the hard way. Halfway through ricing, I made a stupid mistake and broke some of my start up files like xinitrc. I was once again left with some horrifying inception style i3 windows and barely functioning commandline at some point in time. Things spiralled down somehow when I tried to make some fixes but they made things even worse. Moral of the story, I learnt how painful it was having to restart from scratch again.


# Final thoughts

Changing to arch and then learning how to rice was a big change for me which hardened my heart and prepared me for a lot of other setbacks I faced in school and life. This journey taught me an important concept: even when you think you're at the lowest point in life and nothing is working out, things could still get worse from there. Like how my usual fixes bring about even more hazard and eventually I just have to pick myself up all over again.

But that's all okay. It's fine to suck and be bad at things. It's fine to be struggling here and there. It's gonna be damn hard being positive those times and it's fine to be more than a little down at those valley lows.

They always say 'failure is the key to success' and I honestly can't help but disagree with this sometimes. It's not neccesarily the 'key' to success: rather than seeing it as part of success or anything, I think it's maybe better to just accept failure simply as what it is. It's okay to fail. It's okay to not feel okay, and maybe sometimes we need to accept and come to terms with despair before we move on. This is probably a simple case in life where things don't usually work out, and definitely a trivial problem as compared to other issues we might face in future. But I think it definitely forced me to find some head space to reflect about my attitude and the things I love.

To be honest, although I talked about regret at the start of the post, I take back those words: there was never any part of this I would have done differently if given the chance again.

Maybe success isn't necessarily coming straight up ahead. But now, I think it's fine if that weren't the case either.
