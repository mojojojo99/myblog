Hey there! I am Joelle, a CS Major at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm a sophomore (rising junior), and will be specialising in computer systems/ robotics. I'm currently trying out doing some pwns and am very fascinated with kernel programming! I'm also interested in autonomous vehicles, specifically computer vision related fields.

I am an incoming intern at Lyft Level 5 this summer, really looking forward to working on the vehicle integration team!

Besides, I have also previously interned at
- Defence Science Organisation Labs, Singapore (Autonomous Vehicle Department)
- Garuda Robotics, a drone startup based in Singapore

This blog will mainly for me to pen down my thoughts about fascininating things I come across in school, documenting down my travels and also some of my explorations in illustrations and music. :)
